# SLURM Log File
# # Set directory to save slurm log files (if using cluster execution)
# # This can be an absolute or relative path
# # If the directory doesn't exist the pipeline will create it

# General Info
# Specify number of threads for quantification program (salmon or kallisto)
quant_threads: 4
# Specify number of threads for DESeq2
deseq_threads: 4

# Salmon Info
# Location to folder with salmon index file data
salmon_index: /home/groups/carilee/refs/rnaseq-refs/hg38/salmon_index
# Whether Salmon should compute 100 inferential replicates using Gibbs sampling
# Replicates are useful for Terminus to quantify transcript uncertainty
# Value should be true or false

# Variables to color label PCA plot
# Comma separated list of columns specified in samples.csv

# Experimental Design
# NOTE: Interaction designs currently not supported - use deseq2/all.rds and
# write a script to run interaction design
# If you want to regress out patient specific affects, make sure the patient
# variable is a character variable instead of a numeric type to avoid improper
# coding. This can be done by ensuring the patient variable values have text and 
# numbers
design_formula: ~ condition

# Contrasts for DESeq2 to estimate
# These must be for the last (right most) variable in the design_formula
# The specification is numerator-vs-denominator
# Thus if you wanted to compare treated vs untreated samples with untreated
# as the reference level, it would be treated-vs-untreated
contrasts:
    SCC-vs-NormalSkin:
        - SCC
        - NormalSkin
# Factor level ordering for relevant variables in the design formula
# The first value will be the reference level
factor_levels:
    condition: NormalSkin, SCC
